# How to use the App
1. Just like any typical website that contains a database, the potention user will have to sign up for an account, with email, username and password
2. Once the account is created and logged in, the user will have access to their journey page, which allows to add, edit, delete journeys and steps.
3. Creating an account also gives the user access to the community page, allowing that user to view other people's journeys and the ability to leave comments on other user's journeys.

 # 🚀 Next Steps
[Link to my Trello Board for future updates](https://trello.com/b/jac3RvMs)
 - [   ] Adding a search box, so a user can search for a specific journey regarding the title or ending location.  It'll show all users that have journeys matching the search criteria.
 - [   ] Adding the ability to upload photos to a user's journey detail page.  
 - [   ] Adding a calculator for Europeans to use to convert KM to Miles.
